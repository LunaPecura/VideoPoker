# VideoPoker

Videopoker is a type of five card draw poker that is played against the computer, typically at the bar of a casino, while the player is being served free drinks for as long as he or she keeps playing. However, statistically speaking, the house always wins, and consequently a game of videopoker will always eventually lead to a lose state. The player's goal therefore is to keep playing for as long as possible before running out of credits.
